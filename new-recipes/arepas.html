        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 cup pre-cooked white cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Mix water, cornmeal, mozzarella cheese, butter, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                Knead until well combined and a soft dough forms. 
                Form dough into balls the size of a medium orange. 
                Place each ball between two sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a rolling pin to the desired thickness.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Leaving plastic wrap in place, press the top edge of a cereal bowl or drinking glass into the surface of the dough to cut circles. 
                Remove the plastic wrap and remove any excess dough scraps.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Spray a griddle with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. 
                Working in batches, cook arepas on the hot griddle until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. 
                Serve immediately.
